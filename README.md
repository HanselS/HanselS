### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love to code - creating a solution from technologies to solve the problem that is useful for many people.

I am a Computer Science and Mathematics Student at Bina Nusantara University. Majorly I develop a Mobile Application using Flutter, Ionic, Android Java, and worked as a Back-End Engineer using Node.JS. Currently, I also learned and deep dive in data science and analysis, and having a great time to learn Machine Learning using Python :)
